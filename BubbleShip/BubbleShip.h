/*BuildField
Builds a field that is 20 spaces big. The field is an array of characters and should
in the beginning every character should be an o. Do not use a null-terminator. This will
need to dynamically allocate space for a character array and return the pointer.

returns a pointer to an array of 20 characters

/*PromptPlayerForCoords
Prompts user for x coord
Example:
Player 1, enter coords>

playerNumber: The id number of the player
xpos: Address where PromptPlayerForCoords should put the x coordinate retrieved from the user

returns 0 on success
returns -1 on error
*/

/*PlaceShips
Prompts the user for where to place some number of ships.
The function will prompt the user for a position for each ship.
This should call PromptPlayerForCoords

Put an s anywhere there is a ship.

Example run (if looking for 4 ships):
Ship 1 location> 3
Ship 2 location> 7
Ship 3 location> 13
Ship 4 location> 173

This would result in a field like this:
ooosooosooooosooosoo

numShips: The number of ships to place
field: A pointer to the character array which represents the field.

returns nothing

Allows one player to launch attack against another player

playerNumberOfAttacker: The id number of the attacking player
playerNumberOfDefender: The id number of the defending player
fieldOfDefender: A pointer to the defender's field (defender's field should be an array of characters)
xpos: The x coordinate of the attack

returns 9999 if all ships are sunk
returns the number of ships sunk
returns -1 on error
